Step1 - Copy the two files(dictionary.db & dictionary_data.dat) form your language(or the one you made).

(If you have made those files by your self, you dont need the cloned repo now, you can delete it, and instead we are talking about the Release zip/exe installation folder after this)

Step2 - you need to paste/replace those two files here - \data\flutter_assets\assets
(data folder is in the same folder where ekakey.exe is, if you have downloaded it through setup.exe check this location - C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\EkaKey)

when you start the app for the first time it makes ekakey folder at this location - 
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\com.example\ekakey
So if you already had started the app you need to do this extra step (otherwise you are fine)

extra Step - go to this location(C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\com.example\ekakey) and paste/replace those two file here too.


IF YOU CAN'T FIND YOUR LANGUAGE HERE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FILES FOR YOUR LANGUAGE,
JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUUCTIONS GIVEN IN README.MD

AND THEN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PULL REQUEST TO SHARE YOUR DICTIONARY WITH OTHERS
